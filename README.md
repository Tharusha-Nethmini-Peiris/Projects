    - Data structure & Algorithm - 
Breadth First Search (BFS) is the data structure and the Ford-Fulkerson is the algorithm which is used to implement the code. 
BFS is used because of it is a traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes. 
Then it chooses the closest node and explores all the nodes that have to be discovered.
The algorithm repeats the loop for each closest node until it reaches the target. 
The maximum possible flow between a source and a sink in a network is computed using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. 
The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm make use of residual graphs which are an extension of the nave greedy approach that allows undoing operations.
